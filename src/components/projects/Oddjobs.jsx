        As our final project at Northcoders, myself along with four other developers took an idea
        for an app through every stage of the production process from concept development through to
        live demonstration, stopping short of deployment. We followed agile development
        methodologies, utilising a Kanban ticketing system, version control and daily stand-up
        meetings to ensure that we progressed well through our project objectives.

      <h3 className="project-subtitle">The Problem</h3>
      <p className="project-summary">
        There are often times in our home lives where we have a task that we simply donâ€™t have the
        resources to complete the job, be that time, tools or knowledge. For example, DIY,
        gardening, or even renovations too small for professional quotations.
      </p>
      <p className="project-summary">
        OddJobs was created as a community lead solution to that problem, where a user is able to
        share jobs that they require completed. Members of the community are able to see jobs in
        their vacinity and informally offer their own time and expertise.
