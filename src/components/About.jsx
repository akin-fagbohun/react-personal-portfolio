        I got my first modern day introduction to web-dev when I joined a digital marketing agency
        as a content creator some years back. Without going into the details, I found myself taking
        a keen interest in the more technical elements (pretty technical at the time!) such as HTML
        and CSS, as well as the areas of content that had a tangible influence on search engine
        performance.
      </p>
      <p className="project-summary">
        This interest lead to blogging, and from blogging to eCommerce where I would find myself
        running a couple of Shopify stores, responsible for everything from marketing to graphic,
        video and web design. At some point I began to identify as a front-end developer. I had
        clear appreciations for UI/UX and colour theory with a curiosity to explore the actual
        technical aspects that lead me down the line of full stack development.

      <p className="project-summary">
        In 2022, I attended a Northcoders Full-stack bootcamp where I learnt to write production
        level code. Iâ€™m now hoping to advance my career as a software engineer and am excited for
        the opportunity to continue my development in the tech industry.
